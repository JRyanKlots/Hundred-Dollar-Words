# Hundred-Dollar-Words
Code to find "hundred dollar words" as well as a list of possible words.

This program was created by John Ryan Klots (jrk254@cornell.edu) 
in order to demonstrate an application of programming to 
problem solving. The specific problem in this case is 
that of finding english words whose 'value' is 1 dollar.
The value of a word corresponds to the sum of the values of its letters.

a = 1 cent,
b = 2 cents,
c = 3 cents,
.

.
z = 26 cents

The list of possible words (corresponding to wordsEn.txt) are from:
